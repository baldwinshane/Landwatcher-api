- Initialize repository with `src/`, `api/`, and `docs/` directories.
- Define project structure and create initial `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `LICENSE` files.
- Set up development environment (Node.js, dependencies, etc.).
- Establish coding standards and testing framework.

### Milestone 2: Core API Development (Months 2-3)
- Implement core API endpoints in `src/api/` for property data queries.
- Develop logging system for tracking API requests and errors.
- Write unit and integration tests for all endpoints.
- Document API endpoints in `docs/api_reference.md`.

### Milestone 3: Beta Release and Community Engagement (Months 4-5)
