# landwatcher-api

**landwatcher-api** is an open-source initiative designed to monitor and protect large undeveloped rural land parcels, with a special focus on West Virginia and similar regions rich in natural biodiversity. This project aims to prevent the exploitation of ecologically sensitive areas by providing real-time monitoring of land listings and status changes.

## 🌿 Purpose

To track land parcels abundant in wildlife, native flora, and natural landscapes, ensuring their preservation by:
- Identifying listings without existing development or trails.
- Logging when properties go up for sale, accept offers, or are sold.
- Alerting conservationists and allies when large parcels are at risk.
- Providing transparent records via GitHub Pages.

## 🚀 Features

- Query rural land listings via compatible APIs and databases.
- Track and log changes in land parcel status.
- Maintain a contact log for listed parcels.
- Checkbox system to track outreach and notification efforts.
- Public-facing dashboard via GitHub Pages.
- Open-source collaboration encouraged through a clear contribution guide.
