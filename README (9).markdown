- ☐ Alerting conservationists when large parcels are at risk
- ☐ Providing transparent records via GitHub Pages

## 🚀 Features

- ☑ Query rural land listings via compatible APIs and databases
- ☑ Track and log changes in land parcel status
- ☑ Maintain a contact log for listed parcels
- ☑ Checkbox system to track outreach and notification efforts
- ☑ Public-facing dashboard via GitHub Pages
- ☑ Open-source collaboration through a clear contribution guide
